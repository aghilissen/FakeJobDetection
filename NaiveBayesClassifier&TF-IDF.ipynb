       " 'ONLY ONE MANAGER POSITION PER CITY/REGION IS OPEN RIGHT NOW! WORKED FROM HOME BY PHONE OR IN PERSON LOCALLY – YOUR CHOICE! OVER 40 MAJOR CITIES STILL AVAILABLE! YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFIT ON YOUR TEAMS FUNDED DEALS! YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFITS FROM YOUR TEAMS RENEWALS AND STACKS! YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE!  If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully.  Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation.  Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in  Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make.  What a disaster that would be.  Wouldn\\'t you agree?  But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal.  We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry.  We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country.  The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify.  Your manager\\'s agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals.  Gross profit for our  Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions.  Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company.  An  Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders.  Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place).  If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit.  On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40.  So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager.  Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month.  Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal.  So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%,  Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees.  On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager.  Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps.  Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left.  This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days.  We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,   We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail.  We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way.  We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A.  Recruit  Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B.  Train  Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C.  Manage  Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company)  If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business.  If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins.  This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person.  If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad.  If you are a rep sitting in someone else\\'s business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply.  We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area.  But you may recruit offline wherever you want.  So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back.  Again, \"NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY\", \"NO POSITION\". . .  ',\n",

You'll have a passion for the internet and leading web technologies and whilst we don't expect you to be a developer you'll be aware of leading front and back end technologies and know your PHP from JS and CSS and be at ease writing a spec and justifying your approach to a client. You’ll be equally at home managing projects in an agile way as you are confident controlling the budgets.  You’ll also relish working as part of an international team– supporting the studio and simultaneously managing and growing relationships client-side.   You’ll understand the importance of working fast and delivering on time, but never, ever at the expense of quality. This is a fantastic opportunity for a talented, ambitious hard working  Producer looking for an open ended opportunity with a product focus that will be anything but dull.\",\n",

The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, OD Ms and  Component vendors. A word from the  Recruiter: \" Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products.  Most  People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions.  In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features.  This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more.  As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door.\" \" Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware.  Not much of an empowerment here.   Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc.  This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope.  The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity.\"  This is what not shared on the JD. \" How you will mature your career.\"  Job  Responsibilities: •  For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and  Agile release requirements, per  Netgear policies.

YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFIT ON YOUR TEAMS FUNDED DEALS! YOU WILL EARN 40% OF THE GROSS PROFITS FROM YOUR TEAMS RENEWALS AND STACKS! YOU WILL EARN 10% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR TEAMS CLIENT BASE! PLUS: YOU WILL EARN 60% OF FUNDED AMOUNT COMMISSIONS ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF ALL EXTRA FEES CHARGED ON YOUR OWN DEALS YOU WILL EARN 50% OF THE CLIENT EQUITY IN YOUR OWN CLIENT BASE!  If you are working in the merchant cash advance/small business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team, and you want to get paid from all of their efforts, then read this ad carefully.  Our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation.  Our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in  Google indexing under our company name, which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make.  What a disaster that would be.  Wouldn\\'t you agree?  But once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal.  We have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry.  We will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area (city or state or region; depending upon population density), and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country.  The best part is that this can all be done over the phone, if you qualify.  Your manager\\'s agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company, and to get paid 40% of the gross profit on each of their funded deals.  Gross profit for our  Agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions.  Your recruited reps earn either 3%, 5% or 6% on the funded amount of their deals (depending upon the repayment term), plus they earn 50% of any extra fees charged by our company.  An  Example would be, if the deal is a good $50,000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business, then we can now get up to 12% of the funded amount (or more in some cases), as a top sell rate commission from our funders.  Plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2% to 4% (first positions being deals where no other funding is in place).  If we pay your rep 5% to 6% on a deal like that, plus 50% of the fees, then there is a lot of room left over for profit.  On 50K at 12% plus 3% in fees if the rep got 5% commission on the funded amount and 1 and 1/2% in fee commissions ($3250 commission), there would be 7% + 1 and 1/2% left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 60/40.  So $4250 gross profit on that deal = a $1700 override commission for you the manager.  Imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month.  Even on the subprime deals (2nd, 3rd positions, gas stations, sub 500 credit, 6 months in business, etc.) we can now get 6% to 8% of the funded amount, plus charge 3% to 12% in fees depending upon the deal.  So on a real bad deal, worst case scenario, the reps gets 3%,  Our company gets 3% on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5% in fees.  On a 50K subprime deal, that would equal $2750 in gross profit for our company which is an $1100 override commission for you as the manager.  Your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps.  Once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company, and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us, if you ever left.  This opportunity is for a limited time, and even though there is no set quota, if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days.  We also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would re-reimburse you with override commissions paid,   We would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company e-mail and all of your recruiting must be done through that e-mail.  We have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way.  We will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps, but ultimately it will be up to you to: A.  Recruit  Them (using our ad or your own, and by using your contacts locally) B.  Train  Them (using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge) C.  Manage  Them (keep them motivated, answer questions and act as their liaison with our company)  If you do these 3 things, and keep doing it, then you will build a six figure income from this business.  If you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public; which is why we are in this business, besides the great profit margins.  This is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person.  If you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad.  If you are a rep sitting in someone else\\'s business making 3% or 4% of the funded amount of your deals (or less), with little or no residuals and no client equity, and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others, then we welcome you to apply.  We will only give this position to one person to cover any one city, even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country, you can only recruit reps on CL in your designated area.  But you may recruit offline wherever you want.  So when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back.  Again, \"NO EXPERIENCE IN THE MCA INDUSTRY\", \"NO POSITION\". . .  ',\n",
